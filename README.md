# ifttt_php_webhook_sender
Hello, I am Efekan, 
I wrote here because I could solve a problem that I needed in this my project, maybe anyone who wants to benefit.
First of all, my problem was that I could tweet using webhooks and twitter application via ifttt, but my problem was doing it with php so I could connect to my database. I used MySQL database.
*If you want to use it, enter your own data.*

Thanks for using, have a nice day :)
